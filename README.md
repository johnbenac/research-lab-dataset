This repo is a Markdown-canonical dataset for testing content-heavy records and a flexible graph model.

Key features:
- Rich Markdown bodies are primary data (notes, rationale, protocols)
- Relationships exist via YAML reference fields and `[[wiki-links]]`
- Types remain schema-as-data under /types
